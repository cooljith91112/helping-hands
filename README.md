=============

This is a collection of short example programs with extensive comments primarily aimed at students in my computer science classes.  The focus here is getting started with various languages and programming environments like the HTML5 Canvas, Nodebox, Structure Synth, Context Free Art, and so on.

This was created by mFragin, who teaches Computer Science at Skyline High School.  Skyline is a school with both a strong STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) program, and also a super VPA (Visual and Performing Arts) program.  
Because of this, I have, along with the help of graduage fellows from nearby CU-Boulders school of Computer Science (and the ATLAS Institute), build a CS program that tries to be 50% Art and 50% Science.

GENERATIVE ART

There are many great books and sites that make generative art a very accessible way to bring art and CS together.  Also, the Processing project has really caused a incredible surge in excellent generative art projects like Nodebox, Context Free Art, and Structure Synth.  It is my intent here to create a set of beginning sketches for these various frameworks, making it easy for a beginner to get a taste of creating their own art using the framework in question.  As time goes on, the subtle differences between all these options will become clear, and this project may include text files on various topics--not just code.


I have never used GIT before, so be kind.  :-)  I'm switching over from SVN because EVERYONE else is....
